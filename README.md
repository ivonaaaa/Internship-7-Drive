### DumpDrive App ðŸ’¿

The project is built using C# in Visual Studio and is based on a three-tier software architecture. PostgreSQL database is integrated through PgAdmin, while the app communicates with it through LINQ queries and EF Core ORM. While coding this app I also used OOP concepts and some other design patterns.<br>
